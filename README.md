# Snippet Bank

Snippet Bank is an application used as a centralized location to store code snippets.

## Getting Started

The project can be cloned and ran locally.  If choosing to run the application locally, navigate to http://localhost:8089 to start the application (see installation instructions before starting application).  This application is also available on Heroku at the following link:

## Description

Users are given the ability to add, update, and delete snippets.  All snippets are made available in a list, where users can click on individual snippets to see their contents.  Users are given the option to be able to filter snippets by coding language or by their creation date.  Users also have the ability to search snippets based off their title and description.

## Installation

This application uses express, express-handlebars, and mysql as dependencies.  Running "npm install" will install all dependencies.  If choosing to run locally, users must first create the database using the db/schema.sql.  Initially database values can also be provided using the db/seed.sql file.  After dependencies are install and the database is setup, users can run the application by using node to run the server.js file (with command "node server.js") located in the root of the application directory.
